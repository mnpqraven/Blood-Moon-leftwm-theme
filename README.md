# Blood-Moon-Leftwm-theme-

I don't own any of the pictures (besides the screenshots) in this repository. 

If this theme doesn't work check if your themes are using .toml files. This is because the theme file is a .ron file, designed for the latest version of Leftwm. 

If the theme doesn't work with the latest version of leftwm, git clone the leftwm repository to have access to the default themes, copy and paste the basic_polybar theme to your YOURUSER/.config/leftwm/themes. Open files (up script, polybar.config, and theme.ron) for the basic_polybar and delete the contents of those files and copy and this themes file contents (up script, polybar, polybar.config, and theme.ron) or the text of the files and paste it to the basic_polybar files that were emptied of text. Rename your the basic_polybar file to the theme name and delete the theme folder that used to copy the text. Also, copy the basic_polybar back into the same directory if you want the default leftwm polybar theme.
